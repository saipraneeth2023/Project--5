Overview
In this initial capstone session, I'm laying the foundation for my project. I'll dive into a deep exploration of my favorite apps, identifying what makes them tick and thinking about the kind of features I'd like to bring to my own app.

The process of building my own app will begin with identifying the most popular production apps, my personal favorites, and their relevant features that make them stand out.

Agenda
Meet Myself [5 Minutes]

This is my project! For the next few weeks, I'll be working on bringing an exciting iOS app to life. Iâ€™ll take a moment to reflect on my interests and set the stage for productive development.

App Exploration & Benchmarking [15 Minutes]

The point of this exercise is to examine aspects of apps I really love or use frequently in order to identify some of the elements that make a great app.

Steps

I will create a new collaborative HackMD doc for my project notes and planning.
